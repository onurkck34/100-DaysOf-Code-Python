Random Module

Generate Random Integers
The random module provides some special methods for generating random integers.

1. randrange(start, stop, step)
Returns a randomly selected integer from range(start, stop, step). This raises a ValueError if start > stop.

2. randint(a, b)
Returns a random integer between a and b (both inclusive). This also raises a ValueError if a > b.

Here is an example that illustrates both the above functions.

import random
 
i = 100
j = 20e7
 
# Generates a random number between i and j
a = random.randrange(i, j)
try:
    b = random.randrange(j, i)
except ValueError:
    print('ValueError on randrange() since start > stop')
 
c = random.randint(100, 200)
try:
    d = random.randint(200, 100)
except ValueError:
    print('ValueError on randint() since 200 > 100')
 
print('i =', i, ' and j =', j)
print('randrange() generated number:', a)
print('randint() generated number:', c)
Possible Output

ValueError on randrange() since start > stop
ValueError on randint() since 200 > 100
i = 100  and j = 200000000.0
randrange() generated number: 143577043
randint() generated number: 170

List

The list data type has some more methods. Here are all of the methods of list objects:

list.append(x)
Add an item to the end of the list. Equivalent to a[len(a):] = [x].

list.extend(iterable)
Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable. Equivalent to a[len(a):] = iterable.

list.insert(i, x)
Insert an item at a given position. The first argument is the index of the element before which to insert, so a.insert(0, x) inserts at the front of the list, and a.insert(len(a), x) is equivalent to a.append(x).

list.remove(x)
Remove the first item from the list whose value is equal to x. It raises a ValueError if there is no such item.

list.pop([i])
Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is specified, a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list. (The square brackets around the i in the method signature denote that the parameter is optional, not that you should type square brackets at that position. You will see this notation frequently in the Python Library Reference.)

list.clear()
Remove all items from the list. Equivalent to del a[:].

list.index(x[, start[, end]])
Return zero-based index in the list of the first item whose value is equal to x. Raises a ValueError if there is no such item.

The optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in the slice notation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the list. The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the full sequence rather than the start argument.

list.count(x)
Return the number of times x appears in the list.

list.sort(*, key=None, reverse=False)
Sort the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for sort customization, see sorted() for their explanation).

list.reverse()
Reverse the elements of the list in place.

list.copy()
Return a shallow copy of the list. Equivalent to a[:].
