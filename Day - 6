My def function(): print("Hello from a function!") As seen in the example,
the name of the function is given after the def statement (my function).
The parenthesis is opened, the parameters are written,
if any, and the parenthesis is closed. 
Then, when the function is called by putting a colon,
the codes that are requested to run are started to be written.

def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")

my_function()

Python Indentation Rules
The first line of python code cannot have an indentation.
Indentation is mandatory in python to define the blocks of statements.
The number of spaces must be uniform in a block of code.
It is preferred to use whitespaces instead of tabs to indent in python.

Examples : 
def my_name():
  print("Hello I am Onur")
  print("Hi! My name is Onur")
