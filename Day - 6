My def function(): print("Hello from a function!") As seen in the example,
the name of the function is given after the def statement (my function).
The parenthesis is opened, the parameters are written,
if any, and the parenthesis is closed. 
Then, when the function is called by putting a colon,
the codes that are requested to run are started to be written.

def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")

my_function()
