sum(iterable, /, start=0)
Sums start and the items of an iterable from left to right and returns the total.
The iterableâ€™s items are normally numbers, and the start value is not allowed to be a string.

For some use cases,
there are good alternatives to sum().
The preferred, fast way to concatenate a sequence of strings is by calling ''.join(sequence).
To add floating point values with extended precision, see math.fsum().
To concatenate a series of iterables, consider using itertools.chain().
